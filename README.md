# Enhancing-Chain-of-Custody-in-Digital-Forensics-Using-Blockchain-Technology

# Overview
In the field of digital forensics, there is a chance of tampering or manipulation of the data hence, this project is an attempt towards the endeavour of preservation of the evidence by ensuring the integrity and traceability of forensic data for images by leveraging blockchain technology. This solution addresses the challenge of securely logging and verifying the ownership, location, and metadata of images in a forensics context.

# Scope of the project
*	Development of a blockchain structure to securely log forensic data. 
* Implementation of key functionalities:
  * Creation of a genesis block.       
  * Addition of new blocks containing forensic data. 
  *	Validation of the blockchain to ensure data integrity. 
*	Logging metadata such as image ownership, location, and timestamps. 
*	A demonstrative Python implementation showcases the basic functionality. 

# Future Enhancements
1.	Integration with real-world blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger).
2.	Advanced cryptographic features such as digital signatures
3.	A graphical user interface (GUI) or web-based application. 
4.	Scalability testing for large datasets.
